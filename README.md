# ML-for-PB-mode_research
The project exploring the prospects of using different ML methods to predict PB-mode instability

#### ðŸŒ± The project was created as part of the research at the Scientific Laboratory of Advanced Plasma Research Methods for Spherical Tokamaks at Peter the Great St. Petersburg State University on the Globe-M2 tokamak.

## Abstract

PB-mode modeling is a time-consuming task, as it involves solving differential equations on a complex grid. In practice, it takes more than 10 CPU hours and the same amount to verify the results.

The project is dedicated to solving the problem of determining the stability of the peeling balloon mode using machine learning algorithms, which is important for studying edge instabilities in tokamak plasma. Based on the data obtained using numerical modeling of the peeling balloon mode, a comparison of various approaches and machine learning methods for solving this problem was carried out. The obtained results and models can be used for a more detailed study of edge phenomena and the development of plasma control methods, as well as to speed up the processing of experimental data.
